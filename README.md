# Microsoft Bomber

Microsoft Bomber is a tiny python script made for spamming people's emails.
Currently the bomber does not work, but with tiny tweaks it should be able to work again.

If you choose to continue on this tiny project, I would recommend adding proxy support!




## Appendix

The project was made in under 5 minutes, therefor the code isn't as great as it could be.
